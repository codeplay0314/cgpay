Feature Background

Normally, in Gherkin feature testing, all initial data must be set up explicitly as "Background".
To save programming time, our Background includes some specific account and transaction data on the server.
See setupTestData() in hooks.js.

We also use some conventions to specify data in the scenarios:

 - Accounts and their attributes are referred to by name. For example:
   . I am signed in as "Bea" -- means an object with whatever properties are correct for Bea's account.
   . I scan "Bea"            -- means whatever Bea's QR code is.
   . Bea                     -- when listed in a column headed "actorId" means Bea's accountId.
   . Bea/Cit                 -- means Bea acting as an agent for the Citre company.
 - null, true, and false     -- mean those values, rather than those strings.
 - now                       -- means the current second (the server does not store milliseconds, so neither do we).
 - @                         -- in an account identifier means @example.com (Bea's email is b@ meaning b@example.com).

 - In steps and associated API calls:
   . the password is "k".
   . account flags on the server include: ok, member, confirmed, carded, ided, debt (and co for companies)
   . each account has a creditLine of 9,999 and a balance of 9,999.
   . individual accounts have done all steps needed to get a card and company accounts have done all company steps.
   . Abe can manage Citre, Bea can scan cards for Citre, Flo can manage Gisette.

  Test account IDs consist of a format character, followed by the region code "6VM" (Western MA), then several letters
  representing the specific account number.

  QR urls for the accounts are "HTTP://6VM.RC4.ME/" followed by the accountId without "6VM", followed by the cardCode.
