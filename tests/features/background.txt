Normally, all accounts, transactions, and other data on the server must be set up explicitly as "Background".
For Release "A" though, Background includes the following implicit assumptions. 

Note:
  In steps and associated API calls:
  - "." means "NEWZZ" (for example, .A means NEWZZA). You can also sign in with just the letter.
  - "X:Y" means .Y acting on behalf of .X
  - "@" means @example.com (for example, a@ means a@example.com)
  For any accounts created by such steps:
  - the password is "k".
  - flags actually also include: member, confirmed, carded, ided, debt.
  - each account has a creditLine of 9,999 and a balance of 9,999.
  - individual accounts have done all steps needed to get a card and company accounts have done all company steps.

  QR urls for the accounts are as follows, each preceded by "HTTP://6VM.RC4.ME/" and followed by cardCode:

    .A   KDJI
    .B   KDJJ
    .C   KDJK
    .D   KDJL
    .E   KDJM
    .F   KDJN
    .G   KDJO
    .H   KDJP
    .I   KDJQ
    C:A  LDJK0
    C:B  LDJK1
    G:F  LDJO0

The first letter for each account above is the format character. Account identifiers (saved in store.myAccount.accountId)
are composed of the format character followed by "6VM", the remainder of the account code fragment listed above, and
sometimes finally the cardCode.

Implicit Background:

* server has these "accounts":
| id | fullName | email | flags | cardCode | city |
| .A | Abe One  | a@    | ok    | 12345a   | Aton |
| .B | Bea Two  | b@    | ok    | 12345b   | Bton |
| .C | Citre    | c@    | ok,co | 12345c   | Cton |
| .D | Dee Four | d@    | ok    | 12345d   | Dton |
| .E | Eli Five | e@    | ok    | 12345e   | Eton |

| .I | Ida Nine | i@    | ok    | 12345i   | Iton |

* server has these "relations":
| main | other | permission | cardCode |
| .C   | .A    | manage     | 98765a   |
| .C   | .B    | scan       | 98765b   |
| .G   | .F    | manage     | 98765f   |
